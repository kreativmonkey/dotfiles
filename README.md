# That are my dotfiles

This is my experiment to manage my dotfiles. Currently [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/#considering-using-chezmoi) is used for this purpose. 

# How to use

Other people are welcome to look at these dotfiles for inspiration. You won't find anything in them that someone else doesn't use, but 
I've also compiled my dotfiles this way. To install it, which I do not advise anyone but myself, the following must be done:

```bash
# chezmoi init https://github.com/kreativmonkey/dotfiles.git
chezmoi init git@github.com:kreativmonkey/dotfiles.git
```
